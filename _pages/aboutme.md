# IT Operations Manager | Service Delivery & Team Leadership | ITIL/ITSM | Project Management

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Bringing 15+ year of technical experience in Electronics, Audio-Visual, System-Cloud Administration, and Project Management. 

I lead IT operations, service delivery, and strategic initiatives for a 1,000+ user organization – managing everything from team development and $500K operational budgets to cross-functional project coordination and executive stakeholder communication.

### What I do:

I have full personnel management responsibility including hiring, performance management, and team development. I manage our project portfolio using Agile methodologies, implement ITIL service management frameworks, and serve as the bridge between technical teams and business leadership.

### My role encompasses:

- Personnel management – recruiting, hiring, performance reviews, development planning, and difficult decisions when necessary
- Budget oversight – $500K operational budget including procurement, vendor management, and cost optimization
- Project coordination – portfolio management, quarterly reviews, cross-functional stakeholder communication
- Service management – SLA design, knowledge systems, process improvement
- Strategic planning – IT capability assessment, improvement roadmap, executive reporting

### My background is unique:

I combine 7 years of enterprise IT operations with 15+ years of technical production leadership in high-stakes live entertainment environments. This gives me a distinctive perspective on crisis management, zero-tolerance-for-failure operations, and leading teams under pressure.

I've managed theatrical automation systems for 2,000-seat venues, coordinated AV integration for a $1 billion museum opening, and led Microsoft 365 migrations for 1,000+ users. I understand technology deeply, but my real strength is translating technical solutions into business value and leading teams to deliver results.

### What I'm pursuing:

I'm currently completing my PMP certification (May 2025) and ITIL Foundation while staying active in the PMI community and attending industry conferences (HDI Service Management World, Workplace Ninjas).

I'm exploring opportunities in IT Operations Management, IT Service Delivery Management, or Technical Project Management where I can bring my operational leadership, service management expertise, and strategic communication skills to drive organizational excellence.

Let's connect if you're looking for an IT leader who combines technical depth with people leadership, strategic thinking with hands-on execution, and a track record of delivering results in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.
